AB  - Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses an unprecedented challenge to establish effective methods of prevention and treatment. Nanotechnology has shown excellent potential in its ability to fight a variety of healthcare problems due to nanomaterials? unique physicochemical properties and controlled nano-bio interactions. Expanding their application to a wide-range of upstream and downstream approaches is necessary to fight COVID-19. At different stages of this virus-caused disease, nanotechnology could offer promising solutions, including a way to combat the large number of fatalities caused by a late-stage cytokine storm. This mini-review provides an overview of the recent studies regarding nanoparticles? applications in vaccines, personal protective equipment, sterilization of contaminated environments, diagnostic testing, and cytokine reduction treatment in combating COVID-19.
